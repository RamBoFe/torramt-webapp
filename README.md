# Torramt-webapp

This project was created for easily search torrents (for now only on YggTorrent), dowload and manage your torrents on a seedbox (for now with a remote-transmission only), and and transfer directly the file or files from the seedbox to a shared directory on a nas (for now on a nas Synology only).
